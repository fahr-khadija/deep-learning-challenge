Report on the performance of the deep learning model  created for Alphabet Soup.

## Analysis Overview: 
### Proposed  model
In this analysis, the primary objective is to construct a robust deep learning model for predicting the success of funding applications within Alphabet Soup Charity. The dataset, extracted from "charity_data.csv," revolves around the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" variable, serving as the target to delineate funding outcomes.

### Data Preprocessing
   ### Target and Features
      Targets: "IS_SUCCESSFUL"
      Features: Inclusion of all columns, excluding "EIN" and "NAME."
   ### Binning and Encoding
   #### APPLICATION_TYPE Binning:
      Aggregated applications with counts < 500 into the "Other" category.
   #### CLASSIFICATION Binning:
    Collated classifications with counts < 100 into the "Other" category.
   #### Categorical Encoding:
    Employed one-hot encoding through pd.get_dummies to transform categorical columns into numerical equivalents.
